            <h2>Journey to became better Web Developer..</h2>
            <p>
                True winners build themselves during their  practice time.
                That’s something you might have recognized yourself when looking at masterclass performers. You see them doing something and you think to yourself:
                “I wonder how much this person practised for achieving this”.
                Coding is no exception to this rule. And if you want to be a top performer too, you have to include daily practice of your skills in your life.
            </p>
            <h3>You should always have a new Goal And Work toward it...</h3>
            <p>
                This is a very personal belief I have, and it’s something that guides me through my life every day. I feel like people always need to set a new goal in their mind. Something that they want to achieve, and they have to work hard to get it. 
                That’s true for me both on a personal level and in my career. I suggest you set one target at the time for yourself and you build your way toward it.
            </p> 
            <p>   

                For example, you could:

                Build an app you always wanted to create.

                Finally, finish all those Udemy coding courses you have in your library
                Learn a new language you were curious about.

                Learn new patterns, techniques, for improving the code you write daily.

                Find a way to achieve your goals.

                Write down the necessary steps if you feel like.

                This behaviour has immense value. It will make you grow as a professional because you will learn new stuff and practice. It will give you new occasions because you never know what some knowledge can bring you to in the future.
